title: Installing and Running the VM
---


h2. VirtualBox

# From ${SVMP_AOSP_ROOT}/out/target/product/svmp/ copy the files:
    * android_system_disk.vdi
    * android_data_disk.vdi
# Create a VM in VBox using the android_system_disk.vdi as the first hard drive
# Attach android_data_disk.vdi as a 2nd hard drive
# Add a network interface such that the VM can communicate with the SVMP proxy server
# Start it up

Note for laptop users: VirtualBox will pass ACPI data from the host into the VM by default. If you start the VM while running on battery, VBox will incorrectly pass a "sleep" command to the VM causing it to immediately shutdown right after it's finished booting. To correct, either plug in to the wall or configure VBox to not do ACPI pass-through.

Note 2: You can add a serial port device to the VM to get access to dmesg and init console log. If you attach an interactive pty to that serial port, you can also get a local root shell.

h2. VMware

Same as for Virtual Box, but use android_system_disk.vmdk and android_data_disk.vmdk instead.

h2. KVM

Convert android_system_disk.img and android_data_disk.img to QCOW2 format using qemu-img.

<pre>
    $ qemu-img -o compat=0.10 -f raw -O qcow2 android_system_disk.img \
      android_system_disk.qcow2
    $ qemu-img -o compat=0.10 -f raw -O qcow2 android_data_disk.img \
      android_data_disk.qcow2
</pre>

If using virtio para-virtualized disks, make sure to have answered Yes in that part of the build-svmp script.

h2. OpenStack (with KVM compute nodes)

# Convert the system and data disk .img files as in above for stand-alone KVM.
# Upload the resulting images to glance.
# Create a cinder volume based on the android_data_disk glance image. This will become the master copy that every new user's persistent data disk is cloned or snapshotted from.
# Launch a new VM instance from the system disk image. Use a flavor that has at least 1GB for the root disk and 1GB of RAM. Ephemeral disk is unused and can be left as zero.
# Configure the security groups for the VM so that at least inbound TCP port 8001 is allowed. Optionally, allow inboud TCP 5555 for ADB and/or TCP 22 for SSH if you built the VM image with an embedded SSH keypair.
# Create a cinder volume for the user account using the "gold" snapshot from step 3 as the base. Attach this new volume to the now running VM.
# Hard Reboot the VM instance so it can find the now attached data volume.

h2. Data Disks

The default data disk created by the build system and output as android_data_disk.img is a 5GB disk with 4GB assigned to /data and 1GB to /cache.

Several alternate images in a variety of sizes can be found in 'device/mitre/svmp/data-disk-blanks' named by the size of the /data partition. All contain a 1GB cache partition.

h3. Creating a new data disk image from scratch

If the prebuilt images don't fulfill your needs you can create a custom blank data disk with the following steps.

# Create a sparse file of the desired size
  <pre>
    $ dd if=/dev/zero of=android_data_disk.img bs=1 count=0 seek=<SIZE>
  </pre>
# Create partitions within the image for /cache and /data. The /cache partition should be approximately 1GB and /data is configurable, but should be at least 1GB itself.
  <pre>
    $ fdisk android_data_disk.img
    Command: n
    Select: p
    Partition number: 1
    First sector: <enter for default>
    Last sector ... or +size{K,M,G}: +<SIZE of /data>
    Command: n
    Select: p
    Partition number: 2
    First sector: <enter for default>
    Last sector: <enter for default>
    Command: w
  </pre>
# Scan the image and add the new partitions to /dev. Note the loopXpY names the first command for the next step.
  <pre>
    $ sudo kpartx -l android_data_disk.img
    $ sudo kpartx -a android_data_disk.img
  </pre>
# The two partitions should have appeared in /dev/mapper called something like loop0p1 and loop0p2 and should have been printed out by the <code>kpartx -l</code> command.
# Format the two partitions. Replace the device names in the example with the real names from step 3.
  <pre>
    $ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/loopXp1
    $ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/loopXp2
  </pre>
# Unmount the loopback devices
  <pre>
    $ sudo kpartx -d android_data_disk.img
  </pre>

For future consideration, all this could probably be scripted up nicely with libguestfs.
