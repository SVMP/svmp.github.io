h2(#android-client). Android Client

To work with the Android client, check both the client and protocol projects out side by side.

<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/SVMP/svmp-android-client
$ git clone https://github.com/SVMP/svmp-protocol-def
</pre>

h2(#ios-client). iOS Client

h2(#server). SVMP Server

<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/SVMP/svmp-server
</pre>

h2(#vm). SVMP AOSP VM

Checking out the code for the VM itself works similarly to downloading the "Google AOSP code":http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html.

Checking out the master development branch:

<pre>
mkdir svmp ; cd svmp
repo init -u https://github.com/SVMP/android.git
repo sync -j4
</pre>

To check out a stable release version use the '-m' option of repo init to pick the corresponding versioned manifest file like so:

<pre>
repo init -u https://github.com/SVMP/android.git -m svmp-1.3.xml
repo sync -j4
</pre>

This command can be used on an already checked out copy to switch from one tag or branch to another. If switching _to_ the master branch, make sure to still specify a branch `-b master -m default.xml` to ensure it works correcly. If you had previously built the code before switching branches, we advise running a `make clean` before building again.
