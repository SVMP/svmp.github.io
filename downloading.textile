Checking out the code works similarly to downloading the "Google AOSP code":http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html.

Checking out the master development branch:

<pre>
mkdir svmp ; cd svmp
repo init -u https://github.com/SVMP/android.git
repo sync -j4
</pre>

To check out a stable release version use the '-m' option of repo init to pick the corresponding versioned manifest file like so:

<pre>
repo init -u https://github.com/SVMP/android.git -m svmp-1.3.xml
repo sync -j4
</pre>

This command can be used on an already checked out copy to switch from one tag or branch to another. If switching _to_ the master branch, make sure to still specify a branch `-b master -m default.xml` to ensure it works correcly. If you had previously built the code before switching branches, we advise running a `make clean` before building again.
